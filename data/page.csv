IRON OBJECTS FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS OF STRATUM III
AND STRATUM II AT KAMAN-KALEHOYUK: CORRELATION BETWEEN
COMPOSITION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL LEVELS

Hideo AKANUMA

1 INTRODUCTION

During excavations from 1986 to 2001 at the site of
Kaman-Kalehdyiik in central Anatolia, Turkey, many
iron objects have been found. Archaeological and
archaeometallurgical analysis have revealed that iron use
at the site began in the cultural age of Stratum IIIc, in the
Assyrian Colony Period' (Akanuma 1997), and that steel
production and the manufacture of iron artifacts were
probably carried out during the Hittite Empire Period
there (Akanuma 1995). A progressive increase in the
deposits of iron artifacts, lumps, and slag was seen in the
excavation layers of Stratum I] (Akanuma 1999). This
progression, which becomes more evident when the large
iron artifacts found in Stratum Ia (Omura 1998)° are
included, indicates that iron or steel making and the
manufacturing of iron artifacts underwent development
in the period of Stratum II.

Archaeometallurgical analysis has also indicated
that the composition of iron lumps and iron artifacts from
Stratum II differs according to archaeological
provenience level (date) (Akanuma 2000, 2001). One can
possibly conclude that the distribution system of iron

""At Kaman-Kalehdyik in central Anatolia, Turkey, the following
four cultural strata have been examined: Stratum I, Ottoman Period
(16th to 17th centuries A.D.); Stratum II, the Iron Age (end of the
second millennium to the second half of the first millennium B.C.);
Stratum III, Middle to Late Bronze Ages (the second millennium
B.C); and Stratum IV, Early Bronze Age (the third millennium
B.C.) (Omura 1995). Stratum II and Stratum IIT are divided into four
‘and three substrata respectively, from youngest to oldest, Stratum
la, Ib, He, and Hd, Stratum Mla (the Hittite Empire Period), IITb
(the Old Hittite Kingdom Period), and Ile (the Assyrian Colony
Period) (Omura 1995).

The dating of the large iron artifacts (Samples No.1, No.21, No.22,
and No.24), the iron lump (Sample No.25), and the slag (Sample
No.26) is discussed later in this paper and is based on Dr-Sachihiro
Omura’s research.

 

objects or the raw iron materials used to make iron
objects changed over time from Stratum IId to Stratum
Ta. We can also hypothesize that either an increase in the
supply of iron objects or raw iron materials, or an
increase in iron production occurred in the age of
Stratum Ila’. The actual development of the widespread
use of iron is not clear, however, due to the difficulty in
determining the stratigraphic relationship of some
excavation levels within the three substrata in Stratum III
and the four substrata in Stratum II.

In order to resolve this problem, it is necessary to
examine the composition of iron objects excavated from
architectural remains whose date can be more clearly
identified. Doing so shows that the compositions of iron
artifacts from Stratum IIIc, IIb, and Ila are different.
These results indicate that the production and circulation
systems of both raw iron materials and manufactured
iron objects at Kaman-Kalehoyiik may have changed
during the periods of Stratum III and Stratum II. This
paper will explain these results based on the
archaeometallurgical analysis of iron objects found in the
architectural remains excavated during the 11th to 15th
seasons at Kaman-Kalehéyiik.

Twenty-six iron objects (Nos. to 26), consisting of

iron artifacts, iron lumps, and slag, excavated between

1994 and 1999 by Dr. Sachihiro Omura and his

As will be described later, it is quite probable that the steel used to
‘make iron artifacts was not produced directly by smelting. It is fairly
conclusive that some kinds of treatment had been given to iron
produced by smelting, and as a result steel was produced. For this
reason, the terms ""steel"" and ""iron"" are used separately in this paper.",0,eng,92.37795721829856,False,1648423303.73439,1.75
2,"192 H. AKAANUMA coworkers from the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan, were subjected to archaeometallurgical analysis. Table lists the archaeological provenience data for each iron object. Samples from iron objects, with the exception of Nos.16 to 19, were taken in the Kaman-Kalehéyiik laboratory by the author in the summer of 1999. Six iron objects (Nos.4, 16, 19, 20, 25, and 26) and one iron slag (No.10) whose analytical results have already been reported (Akanuma 1995, 1997, 2000, 2001) are also listed in Table 1, and those results are re-examined in this paper. 2-2 Sample preparation Samples of approximately eighty to one hundred milligrams were taken from the iron artifacts that appeared well preserved. This was performed by using a portable drill equipped with a diamond-cutting wheel. Close attention was paid to avoid damage to their intact forms. Iron slag was cut into two portions, and then the samples were extracted from the cut section. Each sample was divided into two parts: the larger part was used for metallographic observation, and the Table 1 Examined iron objects   Description _of Excavation smaller part was used for chemical analysis. 2-3 Analytical method The samples to be used for metallographic observation were sectioned, mounted with epoxy resin, ground with emery paper and then polished using diamond paste. The prepared samples were then examined under an optical microscope. If the sample had large areas of metallic iron, it was etched with nital (2.5ml HNO, and 97.5ml EtOH) before optical examination. Electron microprobe analyses were performed with a JEOL JXA 8800-R, equipped with three wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometers, in order to identify the mineral phase compositions of non- metallic inclusions in the iron artifacts and of slag. The samples to be used for chemical analysis had their external corrosion layers removed with a diamond- coated wheel to avoid contamination from burial deposits. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a PERKIN ELMER Optima 4300DV, was employed for the chemical analysis of the twelve elements contained in the samples.

TRON OBJECTS FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS OF STRATUM Ill AND STRATUM I AT KAMAN-KALEHOYUK: CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND ARCHABOLOGICAL LEVELS 193 sample, mainly consisting of metal from iron artifacts, was washed in an ultrasonic bath with ethyl alcohol and acetone, rinsed with acetone and then dried at 130°C for two hours. The dried samples that were composed primarily of metallic iron were weighed in a TMF vessel; 156ml of HCI (30wt %), 0.4ml HNO, (65wt %), 0.33ml of HF (40 wt %), and 3 ml of twice-distilled water was then added. The closed vessel was put into a microwave oven, using a PERKIN ELMER MUTIWAVE B30MCO3<A, operating at a frequency of 2450MHz, and a three stage program was started (first stage: 100-400W, time 5 min; second stage: 600W, 5 min; third stage: 1000W, 15 min). After cooling, 0.28ml of boric acid (4wt %) was added to the sample, and a second cycle carried out (1000W, 10 min). After cooling again, the solution was transferred into polypropylene bottles and made up to a total volume of 26ml with twice-distilled water. If the dried samples were corroded or were extracted from slag, they were ground to a fine powder in an agate mortar. Thirty-seven milligrams of each powder from the iron artifacts and forty milligrams of each powder from the slag was weighed in a TMF vessel. Then the powder from the iron artifacts was dissolved using the same method described above. The powder from the slag was also dissolved using the same method; however, the volume of chemical reagents was different with 3.3ml of HF and 2.8 ml of boric acid used. The sample solutions were transferred into polypropylene bottles and made into 26ml total volume solutions with twice-distilled water. All the reagents used were Merck Suprapur chemicals. The elements determined, and the analytical lines selected (nm), were as follows: Fe (239.562), Cu (327.393), Ni (231.604), Co (228.616), P (213,617), Mn (257,610), Ti (334.940), Si (251.611), Ca (396.847), Al (396.153), Mg (285.213), V (309.310). Incident power was 1300W. Plasma argon gas flow rate was 15 I/min, auxiliary plasma argon gas flow rate was 0.2 I/min, and aerosol carrier gas flow rate was 0.8 l/min. FeO contained in the slag was analyzed by titrimetric analysis. Carbon and sulfur in the metallic iron of Nos.20 and 25 were tested by the infrared absorptiometric method (IRA) after combustion in a current of oxygen, using a LECO CS444. 3 ANALYTICAL RESULTS 3-1 Chemical composition Tables 2 and 3 report the analytical data obtained by ICP-OES, IRA, and titrimetric analysis. The total iron (T.Fe) content in two samples (Nos.4 and 20) was above 98%, indicating that these samples consisted mainly of metallic iron. Samples No.3 and No.25 were believed to be composed of both metallic iron and iron corrosion, because their T.Fe was between 88 and 94%. The other nineteen samples from the iron artifacts and an iron lump, in Table 2, were composed mainly of iron corrosion, as indicated by their T.Fe content of less than 71%. The carbon content of Samples No.20 and No.25 is 0.023% and 2.16%, respectively. These results coincide well with their metallographic examinations. Samples No.3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 24 are characterized by high contents of Cu, Ni or Co (above 0.06%). It is unlikely that a concentration higher than 100 ppm of any of these three elements could have been derived from the surrounding soil, as the concentration of Cu, Ni, and Co in the surrounding soil is below 30 ppm for each element (see Table 2). Considering there was no direct contact of any of the twenty-three iron objects in Table 2 with materials made of copper or any other metal except iron, the concentrations of these three elements are believed to originate from the objects themselves, specifically from the raw iron materials used to make them. On the other hand, there is a high possibility for contamination of P from the surrounding soil, which has a P content near or above 0.1%. Samples No.8, 10, and 26 (all slag) have a T.Fe content above 34%. Other main components are Si, Ca, and Al, whose concentrations are between 0.6% and 9.2% (see Table 3). Samples No.8 and No.26 have above 58% of FeO, showing that considerable amounts of iron oxide could have been produced in the smelting or refining process. 3-2 Metallographic examination of iron artifacts and an iron lump The surfaces of sample No.4, a ring-shaped object (Fig.Ic,), were covered in a layer of corrosion.

Also, the microstructure of No.4 strongly indicates that heat treatment, especially tempering, may have been performed during manufacture of the object. From these results, we surmise that hypoeutectoid steel was widely used in the manufacturing of iron artifacts during the 20"" to 4"" centuries B.C., and that thermal treatment was given to iron artifacts, if needed be, by the time of Stratum IIb, at the latest. Large iron tools (Nos.1, 21, 22, and 24), large iron slag with a roughly hemispherical shape (No.26) weighing about 1.2kg (Akanuma 2000) and a small iron lump (No.25) were found in Stratum Ia levels. This indicates that iron artifacts, or the steel used to make iron artifacts, were manufactured at Kaman-Kalehdéyiik during the time of Stratum IIa.

two iron lumps (see Table 2). It is believed that the
differences in composition of the slag and the iron
artifacts derive from the fact that there were multiple
manufacturing processes used when converting raw
materials to final products; or if the same manufacturing
process was used, then each manufacturing condition
(including temperature and reaction time) must have
been irregular.

At least three manufacturing processes are needed
to produce steel: smelting, refining, and forging. It is
difficult to say which of these operations were performed
at Kaman-Kalehéyiik during each cultural period
between the 2"" millennium B.C. and the 1"" millennium
B.C., since structures related to iron producing activities
have not been discovered at the site as of yet

Even if the same raw materials are used for the base
substance, the composition of the final products must
change according to the production methods. It is
therefore difficult to recognize any meaningful patterns
by a direct comparison among the values shown in Table
2.

Except for desulfurization and several novel
processes developed recently, the refining of iron and
steel has involved a preferential oxidation of impurity
elements. Three elements (Cu, Ni, and Co) are believed
to remain in the iron metal throughout the processes of
smelting, refining, and forging; it can be easily
concluded by thermochemistry’ that Fe should be
oxidized prior to these three elements. Therefore, their
concentration ratios in the archaeological objects must be
similar to those in the raw materials used to produce the
objects, if no additional alloying was carried out. The
values of (mass%Co) / (mass%Ni) and (mass%Cu) /
(mass%Ni) were calculated for the iron artifacts and the
iron lumps which contain more than 100ppm Ni
(0.0lmass%Ni). Also the values of (mass%Ni) /
(mass%Co) and (mass%Cu) / (mass%Co) were
calculated for the samples containing more than 100ppm
Co. The calculated results are listed in Table 2.

(mass%Co) are indicated on Figs.6a and 6b, where iron
artifacts and iron lumps whose dates are not clear are
expressed with an open circle (O)’. In Fig.6a, Stratum
Ha samples (solid circle:@) No.22 and No.25 are
distributed in the lower left area, and sample No.14 is
located in the middle left area. An iron artifact (No.13)
and an iron lump (No.20) whose strata are not clear, are
also located in the lower left of the diagram. Three iron
artifacts excavated from Stratum IIb (solid triangle:.),
Samples No.4, No.6 and No.7, are located on the
periphery of the lower left part of the diagram. Sample
No.11 from Stratum Ha and Sample No.3, whose stratum
is not clear, are plotted in the upper left and upper right
area, respectively. Sample No.23, an arrowhead from
Stratum II (open square:{_]) is distributed in the lower
central area. Sample No.19, from Stratum III (solid
diamond: ®), is close to Sample No.14. Sample No.9 and
Sample No.12, whose strata are not clear, are plotted
near Sample No.6 and Sample No.7, respectively.

In Fig.6b, Samples No.3, No.4, and No.23 are
distributed in the lower left area, and Samples No.13 and
No.20 are plotted in the lower right area. Samples No.1!
and No.19 are in the upper left area and the upper right
area, respectively. Samples No.7 and No.12 are
distributed near Samples No.3, No.4, and No.23. The
iron artifacts found in R150, belonging to Stratum IIIc,
and the large iron tools from Stratum Ia (Samples No.1,
No.21, and No.24) could not be plotted in Figs.6a and 6b
because of their low Ni and Co contents (under
0.01mass%).

Samples No.13 and No.20 are plotted in the same
area as Samples No.22 and No.25 in Fig.6a. But in
Fig.6b Samples No.22 and No.25 could not be plotted
because of their low Co content (below 0.01mass%).
Taking into consideration that the value of (mass%Cu) /
(mass%Ni) of Sample No.14 is forty-five times greater
than those of Samples No.13 and No.20, it is difficult to
assign a date to latter samples on the basis of
archaeometallurgical analysis.

The above archaeometallurgical data seems to
indicate that the composition of iron objects was

distinctly different in each cultural stratum. This
indicates that the means of procuring iron objects
(necessary for everyday life) and the raw iron materials
to manufacture iron objects may have changed along
with political and economic fluctuations in the region of
Kaman-Kalehéyiik. Multiple means of obtaining iron
objects and raw iron materials may also have existed.
The wide scatter of the three trace element ratios among
the iron artifacts from Stratum Ila and Stratum IIb seems
to express the complicated trade system in the cultural
age of Stratum I,

The similarities in trace element composition
between Samples No.22 and No.25 and between Samples
No.7 and No.12 may indicate that they were made of iron
produced from the same raw material. Through analysis
of ore bodies, it may be possible to determine their
sources. This point should be investigated further,
analyzing the other trace elements that remain in the
metal regardless of the manufacturing methods.

4-2 Production activities relating to iron in the
period of Stratum IIa

As mentioned above, the quantity of excavated iron
artifacts, iron lumps and iron slag pieces increased in the
levels belonging to Stratum Ia. Several iron tools larger
than those excavated in older levels were also found in
the level believed to be Stratum Ia. These materials
suggest that a progression of manufacturing techniques,
an increase in the production of steel, and an increase in
the circulation of iron artifacts or raw iron materials
occurred.

The general belief regarding the steel making
method in the first and second millennium B.C. is as
follows: iron ore was reduced with CO-gas and changed
into sponge iron (a mixture of solid iron, slag, and pieces
of unburned charcoal). The resultant iron was pulled out
of the furnace and the slag adhering to it was removed by
subsequent hammering. Finally, soft steel was obtained
(Tylecote 1992).

The large piece of slag (No.26) with a roughly
hemispherical shape and weighing approximately 1.2kg

""In the cultural age of Stratum IIb, Kaman-Kalehdylik is thought to
have established an economic or political relationship with Western
Anatolia (Matsumura 2000).

whose convex curves are covered with iron corrosion,
was discovered in the South Sector (Akanuma 2000).
This slag is believed to belong to Stratum Ia. The main
components of the slag object are iron oxide, Si, Ca, and
Al. It is almost certain that it was produced after a state
in which molten or partially molten slag was in contact
with metallic iron, Iron lump No.25, primarily composed
of cast iron (iron with the carbon content above 2.0%)
and proeutectoid steel (steel with the carbon content
above 0.8%), was excavated along with Slag No.26
(Fig.5b, ,). Charcoal should have been present in the slag
and the iron lump, if they have coexisted within the same
reaction site. However, the slag and iron lump had no
charcoal, when they were examined. Therefore, the
reaction site where the slag and the iron lump were
produced may have been separated from charcoal as the
thermal source during the operating process.

It is unlikely that these objects were produced
during the smelting process and the forging process,
during which sponge iron was hammered and iron
objects were manufactured. Therefore, we can
hypothesize an operation other than smelting and
forging, most likely refining, with some kind of melting
operation, was performed in order to convert raw iron
materia

 

s into steel. Two possibilities exist for this result.
The first possibility is that simultaneous smelting and
refining of iron was performed at the site. The other
possibility is that refining of raw iron materials supplied
from another area was carried out at the site. It might be
that Slag No.10, excavated from the North Sector, with
the almost same shape and the same composition as Slag
No.26 (Akanuma 2000), was produced along with No.26.

Considering the fact that the composition of iron
artifacts and iron lumps changed over time during the
cultural ages of Stratum III and I at Kaman-Kalehéyiik,
it can be suggested that the distribution system of raw
iron materials to make steel or manufactured iron
artifacts had already been established in the Central
Anatolian region, before the cultural age of Stratum Ila,
and that steel and iron artifacts were produced at the site
using those raw iron materials brought from other areas.
This matter should be clarified by further research,
including ascertaining the composition of the raw iron
materials used as a base material for producing steel. In
order to clarify the details of production activities at",0,eng,94.01438606387225,False,1648423337.247156,1.75

Kaman-Kalehéyiik, we should gather as much
information as possible about the structure of furnaces
and tools. Furthermore we should strive for the accurate
restoration of steel making equipment, and the
simulation of the steel making method by using the
restored equipment. We also need to compare the
archaeometallurgical results with data taken from other
archaeological sites in Turkey and surrounding area.
With further research of this kind, we may assess the
actual condition of steel production, and the
manufacturing and use of iron objects in the Central
Anatolian region in the first and second millennium B.C.
