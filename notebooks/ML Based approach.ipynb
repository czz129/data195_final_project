FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS OF STRATUM III AND STRATUM II AT KAMAN-KALEHOYUK: CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL LEVELS   Hideo AKANUMA   1 INTRODUCTION   During excavations from 1986 to 2001 at the site of Kaman-Kalehdyiik in central Anatolia, Turkey, many iron objects have been found. Archaeological and archaeometallurgical analysis have revealed that iron use at the site began in the cultural age of Stratum IIIc, in the Assyrian Colony Period\\' (Akanuma 1997), and that steel production and the manufacture of iron artifacts were probably carried out during the Hittite Empire Period there (Akanuma 1995). A progressive increase in the deposits of iron artifacts, lumps, and slag was seen in the excavation layers of Stratum I] (Akanuma 1999). This progression, which becomes more evident when the large iron artifacts found in Stratum Ia (Omura 1998)° are included, indicates that iron or steel making and the manufacturing of iron artifacts underwent development in the period of Stratum II.   Archaeometallurgical analysis has also indicated that the composition of iron lumps and iron artifacts from Stratum II differs according to archaeological provenience level (date) (Akanuma 2000, 2001). One can possibly conclude that the distribution system of iron   \"At Kaman-Kalehdyik in central Anatolia, Turkey, the following four cultural strata have been examined: Stratum I, Ottoman Period (16th to 17th centuries A.D.); Stratum II, the Iron Age (end of the second millennium to the second half of the first millennium B.C.); Stratum III, Middle to Late Bronze Ages (the second millennium B.C); and Stratum IV, Early Bronze Age (the third millennium B.C.) (Omura 1995). Stratum II and Stratum IIT are divided into four ‘and three substrata respectively, from youngest to oldest, Stratum la, Ib, He, and Hd, Stratum Mla (the Hittite Empire Period), IITb (the Old Hittite Kingdom Period), and Ile (the Assyrian Colony Period) (Omura 1995).   The dating of the large iron artifacts (Samples No.1, No.21, No.22, and No.24), the iron lump (Sample No.25), and the slag (Sample No.26) is discussed later in this paper and is based on Dr-Sachihiro Omura’s research.       objects or the raw iron materials used to make iron objects changed over time from Stratum IId to Stratum Ta. We can also hypothesize that either an increase in the supply of iron objects or raw iron materials, or an increase in iron production occurred in the age of Stratum Ila’. The actual development of the widespread use of iron is not clear, however, due to the difficulty in determining the stratigraphic relationship of some excavation levels within the three substrata in Stratum III and the four substrata in Stratum II.   In order to resolve this problem, it is necessary to examine the composition of iron objects excavated from architectural remains whose date can be more clearly identified. Doing so shows that the compositions of iron artifacts from Stratum IIIc, IIb, and Ila are different. These results indicate that the production and circulation systems of both raw iron materials and manufactured iron objects at Kaman-Kalehoyiik may have changed during the periods of Stratum III and Stratum II. This paper will explain these results based on the archaeometallurgical analysis of iron objects found in the architectural remains excavated during the 11th to 15th seasons at Kaman-Kalehéyiik.   2 EXPERIMENTAL   2-1 Archaeological objects Twenty-six iron objects (Nos. to 26), consisting of   iron artifacts, iron lumps, and slag, excavated between   1994 and 1999 by Dr. Sachihiro Omura and his   As will be described later, it is quite probable that the steel used to ‘make iron artifacts was not produced directly by smelting. It is fairly conclusive that some kinds of treatment had been given to iron produced by smelting, and as a result steel was produced. For this reason, the terms \"steel\" and \"iron\" are used separately in this
